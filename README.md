# React + Vite

This repo was my first personally project. I wanted to try and to learn the process to do it. Nowadays, this project is migrated to Astro and the building is bette; some styles and refactor had been fixed, but not in this repo!
In Astro, the portfolio had been made only with HTML5 and CSS with js as little as possible.
